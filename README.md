# rest-api-crud
This is my first rest api for the crud app in Node, Express and MongoDB.
And I love it.
# Detailed operations descriptions
You can fork the project and enjoy the detailed descriptions for all the operations that you need to create the rest api. 
# No front-end
The project has no front-end, and I used the REST Client to interact with the API.
